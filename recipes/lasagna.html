    <h1>Lasagna</h1>
    <img src="/Photos/lasagna.jpg" alt="A picture of Lasagna" width="400" height="400">
    <p>Everyone loves a good lasagna, right?
        It's a great way to feed a crowd and a perfect dish to bring to a potluck. 
        It freezes well. It reheats well. Leftovers will keep you happy for days.  
        Simply Recipes reader Alton Hoover sent me his favorite recipe for lasagna 
        which he has been cooking since his college days. Alton's original recipe created 
        enough lasagna for a small army so I halved it. 
        What is posted here will easily serve eight people.</p>
